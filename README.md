# POC: Integration of "unlighthouse" for FE App Performance Evaluation

This repository serves as a Proof of Concept (POC) for integrating the "unlighthouse" tool into the Continuous Integration (CI) process to evaluate the performance of Front-End (FE) application branches, including PR branches and the main branch.

## Features

- Auth0 Integration: The FE app uses Auth0 for authentication. This POC provides an example implementation to bypass the authentication screen, allowing "unlighthouse" to run performance evaluations on the remaining pages.

- Real-time Tracking: The POC showcases the integration of status reports and real-time tracking of performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO) optimization levels for the FE application.

## Goal

The main goal of this POC is to provide an example of integrating status reports and real-time tracking of performance and SEO optimization levels for the FE application. These metrics are crucial for ensuring high discoverability through search engines and maintaining optimal performance.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to get started with the POC:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the Auth0 authentication credentials.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Run the "unlighthouse" tool on the relevant pages of the FE app.
5. View the real-time performance and SEO optimization reports.
